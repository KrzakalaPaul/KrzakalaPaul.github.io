I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Florence d'Alché-Buc](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/), [Rémi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com) and [Charlotte Laclau](https://laclauc.github.io/) in **Télécom Paris** and **Ecole Polytechnique**. 

Research Topic
======
My PhD focuses on applying **Deep Learning** to **Structured Data** through differentiable algorithms inspired by **Optimal Transport**.
I also work on applying these approaches to real-world data, with a particular focus on **large molecular data** and **attention-based** architectures.

My other topics of interests include generative modelling and the robustness of deep learning models to evasion and data poisoning adversarial attacks.
