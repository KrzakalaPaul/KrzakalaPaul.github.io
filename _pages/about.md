Research Topic
======
My PhD focus on applications of **Optimal Transport** to the prediction of **structured data** (such as graphs) with **Deep Learning**. My other topics of interests include attention mecanisms, graph learning, and the robustness of deep learning models to evasion and data poisoning adversarial attacks.
