About Me
======
I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Florence d'Alché-Buc](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/), [Rémi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com/index.fr.html/) and [Charlotte Laclau](https://laclauc.github.io/) in **Télécom Paris** and **Ecole Polytechnique**. 

Research Topic
======
My PhD focus on applications of **Optimal Transport** to the prediction of structured data (such as graphs) with Deep Learning. My other topics of interests include attention mecanism and the robustness of deep learning models to evasion and data poisoning adversarial attacks.
