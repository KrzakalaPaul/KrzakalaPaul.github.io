I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Florence d'Alché-Buc](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/), [Rémi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com) and [Charlotte Laclau](https://laclauc.github.io/) in **Télécom Paris** and **Ecole Polytechnique**. 

Research Topic
======
My PhD focus on applications of **Optimal Transport** to the prediction of **structured data** (such as graphs) with **Deep Learning**. My other topics of interests include attention mecanisms, graph learning, and the robustness of deep learning models to evasion and data poisoning adversarial attacks. 

News
======
Any2Graph, my first phd year paper, has been accepted as a **spotlight at Neurips 2024**! Preprint is already available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12269). sss
